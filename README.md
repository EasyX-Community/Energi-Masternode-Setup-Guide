##### This is a simple guide to show you step by step how to setup your Energi / NRG Masternode.

__Throughout this guide__ you will find referral links, all that I ask is that you use them to support my work. I also ask that should you modify these instructions that you keep the referral links there - unless of course, your new instructions use another service not already referred. I also ask that you leave these warnings and notices here. __Thank you!__
