# Energi GEN3 Masternode Setup Guide<br />


#### This is a simple guide to show you step by step how to setup your GEN3 Energi / NRG Masternode.

__Throughout this guide__ you will find referral links, all that I ask is that you use them to support my work. Should you modify these instructions that you keep the referral links there - unless your new instructions use another service not already referred. I also ask that you leave these warnings and notices here. 

__Anyone who forks this repository without leaving these notices here is trying to scam you!__

### Troubleshooting any issues

##### Trouble: Signature errors during APT update/upgrade
Example:
```
[ubuntu@server ~]$ sudo apt-get update
Ign http://security.ubuntu.com trusty-security InRelease
Get:1 http://security.ubuntu.com trusty-security Release.gpg [933 B]
...
Fetched 21.9 MB in 14s (1,537 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
W: GPG error: http://security.ubuntu.com trusty-security Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5 NO_PUBKEY 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
W: GPG error: http://archive.canonical.com trusty Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5 NO_PUBKEY 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com trusty Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5 NO_PUBKEY 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com trusty-updates Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5 NO_PUBKEY 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
[ubuntu@server ~]$ 
```
__Solution:__<br />

Run the following command and replace SIGNATURE with the signature missing the PUBKEY from above:
```
[ubuntu@server ~]$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys SIGNATURE
```
Example:
```
[ubuntu@server ~]$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
```
