__WARNING:__ NEVER download files except from the [Energi Wiki](https://docs.energi.software/) unless at your own risk!<br />
__WARNING:__ NEVER let anyone install your Masternode for you! This guide will help you :)<br />
__WARNING:__ NEVER let anyone access your Masternode with ANY remote access tools (ssh, ftp, TeamViewer, etc.)

#### This is a simple guide to show you step by step how to setup your Energi / NRG Masternode.

__Throughout this guide__ you will find referral links, all that I ask is that you use them to support my work. I also ask that should you modify these instructions that you keep the referral links there - unless your new instructions use another service not already referred. I also ask that you leave these warnings and notices here. 

Anyone who forks this repository without leaving these notices here is trying to scam you!

__Thank you!__
